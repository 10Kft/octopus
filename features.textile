h1. Octopus Features List:

* Support for replicated databases, with one master and multiple slaves. Multi-master support could be added later. The writes will be sended to master and the reads to slave, but this could be modified.
* Support database sharding, with a nice and clean syntax like: 
  User.using(:awesome_shard).all() 
  or 
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    sharded_by :code
  end
* Running migrations between shards, example:
  class MyAwesomeMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration
    using :awesome_shard
    
    def self.up
      create_table :users do |t|
        t.string :name
      end
    end

    def self.down
      drop_table :users
    end
  end
* An initial generator will be integrated in to the project, to help people using octopus, this will generate the config file: db/shards.yml, and a initializer to help the configuration.
* The sharding config will be separated from the database.yml file, given a more cleaner and nice configuration file.
* All of code will be covered by specs.
